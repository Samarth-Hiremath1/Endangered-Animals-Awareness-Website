      <h1 style="color: yellow; margin: 0;">WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO PROTECT ANY SPECIES IN THIS WORLD? </h1>
      <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size:25px; ">Ever since we humans can to earth, there has been a decline in the diversity of species. Ever since we humans started to make metropalopean cities, there has been a bigger decline in the diversity of species. Ever since the population of us humans increased exponentially in the past century, there has been a massive decline in the biodiversity of species. This is because we humans are the cause of the extinction of many species and although we cannot reverse our actions, we can things to redeem our respect. Many species become endangered because of habitat loss, introduction of invasive species, pollution, human population, and the over-hunting of animals. We should care about all the organisms around us for many reasons. We should especially care about the endangered organisms because we do nothing, those species can be lost forever. Species should be protected because they are extremely important to an environment. For example, if a predator, such as the Amur Leopard, goes extinct, the population of its prey will increase rapidly. When that happens, that species will eat up a lot of its prey. In the end, there would not be enough food for all the organisms and there would be a lot of death. This will also decrease the biodiversity of the environment. Biodiversity is the key indicator of the health of an ecosystem. A wide variety of species will cope better with threats than a limited number of them in large populations. For example, if a disease enters a ecosystem, the species would have a higher chance of being immune to the disease because there would be more diversity in the genes. Healthy ecosystems clean our water, purify our air, maintain our soil, regulate the climate, recycle nutrients and provide us with food.

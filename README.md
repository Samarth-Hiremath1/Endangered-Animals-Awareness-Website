# Endangered-Animals-Awareness-Website
Used HTML, Python, Javascript, and CSS to integrate the Google Maps API to a webpage informing users about endangered species. The page features an 
interactive map where users can hover over animals from different global locations to find out more information. I worked on this project at my 
first hackathon in 2019 with Gurshan Brar and Sambhav Agarwal.
